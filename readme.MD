This is a simple javascript and manifest to use in Firefox with Tinkercad.

It overrides the Zoom function to use the Ctrl-Key and mousewheel.

Tinkercad is a good program and could be great with a few settings.  The ability to change keyboard commands or mouse 
functionality would be a an easy addition and be most welcom.

It was almost unusable for me because of the granularity of the zoom and the Magic Mouse.

When you have the Magic mouse setup to use the right side of the mouse for the right button and you are using the 
left button and then swipe across to the right button it creates a Mouse wheel event that zooms Tinkercad.
